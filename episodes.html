            <h2>Homer's Enemy (Season 8, Episode 23)</h2>
            <p>
                Considered by many to be one of the darkest and most brilliant episodes, "Homer's Enemy" introduces Frank Grimes, an exceptionally hard-working man who becomes increasingly enraged by Homer's effortless success and incompetence. It's a sharp piece of meta-commentary on the entire premise of the show, highlighting the absurdity of Homer's life through the eyes of a "normal" person.

            <h2>King-Size Homer (Season 7, Episode 7)</h2>
            <p>
                In this episode, Homer intentionally gains 61 pounds to qualify for disability, allowing him to work from home and escape the daily exercise it requires. His journey to gaining weight, the resulting chaos, as well as his attempts to work from home deliver pure Homer comedy to its fullest extent. It's a masterful display of physical humor and satire.

            <h2>Cape Feare (Season 5, Episode 2)</h2>
            <p>
                A parody of the 1991 film *Cape Fear*, this episode is a vehicle for Sideshow Bob to attempt to murder Bart after being released from prison. It contains arguably the show's best running gag—Sideshow Bob repeatedly stepping on rakes—and is a hilarious, tension-filled classic that showcases the fantastic voice work of Kelsey Grammer.
