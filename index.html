    <span class ="accent-text">If I had to choose one show to watch for the rest of time, there's no doubt that it'd be The Simpsons.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Simpsons has been my favorite show for years because of its clever blend of comedy, satire, and heart, especially during the early years of the show.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only has this show had an immense impact on my sense of humor, but it's defined a generation and its impact will not be forgotten.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen every episode so many times that there are few episodes whose plot I don't know from the name alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many iconic jokes, gags, and references that I find myself quoting whenever they're relevant, even when no one else seems to get it.
