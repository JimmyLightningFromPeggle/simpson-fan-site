  <h2>Homer Simpson</h2>
  <p>
    The patriarch of the Simpson family, Homer is known for his simple-mindedness, love of donuts, and famous catchphrases like "D'oh!"&nbsp;&nbsp;He works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;While he often causes chaos, his deep, if often misplaced, love for his family is the core of his character.

  <h2>Moe Szyslak</h2>
  <p>
    Moe is the owner and bartender of Moe's Tavern, a dingy establishment that serves as the local watering hole for Homer and his friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is generally cynical and short-tempered, but occasionally shows glimpses of a caring, if lonely, person.&nbsp;&nbsp;His constant prank phone calls from Bart are a classic running gag.

  <h2>Ned Flanders</h2>
  <p>
    Ned Flanders is Homer's overly cheerful, devoutly religious, and annoyingly perfect next-door neighbor.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is known for his signature greeting, "Hi-diddly-ho, neighborino!"&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Homer's consistent disapproval and often mean-spirited actions toward him, Ned remains unfailingly polite and generous.
